# Open-ISO7816-Stack
This is a port of the Open-ISO7816-Stack (an ISO/IEC 7816-3 contact smart card protocol stack) from STM32F407 to STM32F103C8T6. The project involves adapting the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), testing core functionalities, and providing a working library for resource-constrained ARM Cortex-M3 targets.
